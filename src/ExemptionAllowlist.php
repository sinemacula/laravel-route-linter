/**
 * Domain service that suppresses waived violations and tracks stale entries.
 *
 * Constructed from the exemption entries supplied by the rule-configuration
 * port, this service answers whether a given route carries a per-rule allowlist
 * suppression, and records which entries were matched so unmatched entries can
 * be reported as stale waivers after the full route table has been inspected.
 * An empty allowlist is the shipped default; in that state no route is
 * suppressed and no stale entries are ever reported.
 *
 * The two-phase protocol is:
 * 1. Call `observe()` once per live route so pattern-match tracking is driven
 *    by the full route table (not just routes that have violations).
 * 2. Call `suppresses()` per violation to test per-rule coverage and record
 *    usage.
